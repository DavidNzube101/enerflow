# enerflow: modeling the flow of energy 

## Python framework for sequential decision problems in the energy sector

**enerflow** is a Python framework for modeling sequential decision problems in the energy sector. It is based on both OpenAI Gym (now [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)) and [Warran Powell's decision framework](https://castle.princeton.edu/rlso/). enerflow enables you to: 

* üõ§Ô∏è Structure your code as modular and reusable components and adopt the "model first, then solve"-mantra. 
* üèóÔ∏è Build agents, predictors, optimizers and simulators to solve sequential decision problems
* üå± Forumate your problems as environments and evalute pre-existing solutions
* üß™ Run parametrized experiments that generate reproducible results (code, data and parameters)
* ‚ûø Run sweeps for benchmarking, scenario analysis and parameter tuning


As energy systems world-wide continue to decarbonise through deployment of renewable and fossil-free energy, they are also becoming more intermittent and complex. We need better data-driven methods to handle this complexity, with `python` rapidly becoming the tool-of-choice for energy modellers. 

1. **Occam‚Äôs Razor / Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):** the best solution is usually also the simplest one. Over-engineering is the root of all evil. 
2. **Community-first:** Iterate tightly with the ecosystem and community of energy modelers to understand and find the best solution. 
3. **People-first:** Making code explicit, readable and intuitive counts. ‚ÄúPrograms are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute‚Äù.

# Could we have some sort of picture here in the beginning? E.g. mindsdb

## Purpose and philosophy
Write about that it is the connection with energydatamodel

Run your high-level Keras workflows on top of any framework -- benefiting at will from the advantages of each framework, e.g. the scalability and performance of JAX or the production ecosystem options of TensorFlow.
Write custom components (e.g. layers, models, metrics) that you can use in low-level workflows in any framework.
You can take a Keras model and train it in a training loop written from scratch in native TF, JAX, or PyTorch.
You can take a Keras model and use it as part of a PyTorch-native Module or as part of a JAX-native model function.
Make your ML code future-proof by avoiding framework lock-in.
As a PyTorch user: get access to power and usability of Keras, at last!
As a JAX user: get access to a fully-featured, battle-tested, well-documented modeling and training library.
