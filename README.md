**enerflow** is a Python framework for modeling sequential decision problems in the energy sector. It is based on both OpenAI Gym (now [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)) and [Warran Powell's decision framework](https://castle.princeton.edu/rlso/). enerflow enables you to: 

* üõ§Ô∏è Structure your code as modular and reusable components and adopt the "model first, then solve"-mantra. 
* üèóÔ∏è Build agents, predictors, optimizers and simulators to solve sequential decision problems
* üå± Forumate your problems as environments and evalute pre-existing solutions
* üß™ Run parametrized experiments that generate reproducible results (code, data and parameters)
* ‚ûø Run sweeps for benchmarking, scenario analysis and parameter tuning


As energy systems world-wide continue to decarbonise through deployment of renewable and fossil-free energy, they are also becoming more intermittent and complex. We need better data-driven methods to handle this complexity, with `python` rapidly becoming the tool-of-choice for energy modellers. 

1. **Occam‚Äôs Razor / Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):** the best solution is usually also the simplest one. Over-engineering is the root of all evil. 
2. **Community-first:** Iterate tightly with the ecosystem and community of energy modelers to understand and find the best solution. 
3. **People-first:** Making code explicit, readable and intuitive counts. ‚ÄúPrograms are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute‚Äù.
